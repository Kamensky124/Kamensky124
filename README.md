I like to implement real projects and increase their efficiency by optimizing work with data and automation. Previously, I improved local accounting systems, including SAP and legacy oracle- and excel-based systems at large enterprises.
Since November 2022, I have changed my specialization to frontend web development.
Javascript and its frameworks attract me with its wide application in a variety of industries. So now I'm studying it hard, solving katas on Codewars for the best use of my accumulated experience in business.
I am looking for a best team or project for frontend development.
My trail running hobby all year round increase myself productivity. A healthy body makes a healthy spirit :) 
I have an 8-year-old daughter and love her very much.

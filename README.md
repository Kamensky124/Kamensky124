<p>I'm passionate about making a real impact on projects by streamlining data workflows and automation.  In my previous role, I focused on optimizing local accounting systems, including complex solutions like SAP and legacy Oracle & Excel setups for large enterprises.</p>

<p>Since November 2022, I've transitioned my focus to frontend web development. The versatility and vast industry applications of JavaScript and its frameworks truly excite me.  Leveraging my extensive business experience, I'm actively honing my JavaScript skills by tackling Codewars katas.</p>

<p>I'm eager to join a fantastic team or contribute to a project where I can leverage my frontend development expertise. </p>

<p>(On a personal note) Trail running is my year-round passion, keeping me productive and energized. After all, a healthy body leads to a healthy mind! :)</p>

<p>I'm also a proud parent to an amazing daughter.</p>

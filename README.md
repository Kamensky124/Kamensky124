I am focused on results and productivity at work. When solving any task, I find ways to automate it as much as possible. If this is a regular calculation - it should be performed as quickly as possible. If it is a representation of the data, it should be as informative as possible. After many years of working in large companies in financial and engineering positions, programming has brought mindfulness back into my life.

In addition to my main job, I worked as a photographer for 4 years and designed photo books. I have organized and conducted photo shoots for more than 40 weddings and many family photo shoots. Thanks to this, I improved my communication skills with people, learned how to create whole stories and get a full-fledged product.

I love to constantly learn new things, organize and 'refactoring' my knowledge with obsidian zettelkasten.

I participated in the creation of a project management system, construction documentation database.

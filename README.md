<p>I like to implement real projects and increase their efficiency by optimizing work with data and automation. Previously, I improved local accounting systems, including SAP and legacy oracle- and excel-based systems at large enterprises.</p>
<p>Since November 2022, I have changed my specialization to frontend web development.</p>
<p>Javascript and its frameworks attract me with its wide application in a variety of industries. So now I'm studying it hard, solving katas on Codewars for the best use of my accumulated experience in business.</p>
<p>I am looking for a best team or project for frontend development.</p>
<p>My trail running hobby all year round increase myself productivity. A healthy body makes a healthy spirit :) </p>
<p>I have an 8-year-old daughter and love her very much.</p>
